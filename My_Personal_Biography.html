<p>My name is Siti Roslaini Binti Muhamad Azrul Hisam and people usually call me "lainiey". So this is my personal biography and i'm going to share a little bit about mylife. First of all, i am final year student of Diploma in Information Managemenmt (IM110) at University Technology Mara (UiTM) Kampus Machang, Cawangan Kelantan. I was born on December 12, at Hospital Kuala Krai, Kelantan. I am the third from 4 siblings. My father's name is Muhamad Azrul Hisam Bin Awang@Zakaria, he is 47 years old and my mother's name is Zuraidah Binti Samsudin, she is 40 year old, still young and pretty. Both of them are working as a ruber tapper. I think i am a person who likes to be alone especially when i wacthing a drama. It is because,when we are watching drama or movie together, we need to holding back the feelings that we got from that drama. That is so embarrassing if i am going to cry just because of the drama infront of others. The type of drama that i really love is korean and thailand drama. I am a person who do not likes the noisy environment and hate the violence. That is make me feel to do my own business and not to busybody of other.</p>
<p>At the University, i was joined Uniform of Kor Sukarelawan Siswa Siswi (SUKSIS) for five semester. I had learn to become a strong person by working in the team. There is a saying: "One for All, All for One". Then, i realized it is true when we work in the team, we need to be cooperate, that is something that can make us become stronger. But when we are not cooperate in the team work, that's can make us become weak and destroy the team work.</p>
<p>For the social media application, there are a lot of social media platform that people used nowdays. But not for me. I am only had two media social account for facebook and instagram. I am use the facebook as a place to collect the drama and movie for my collection, and for instagram, i am using it to get information and update entertainment and global news.</p>
